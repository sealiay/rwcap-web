The RWCap is a parallel program suitable for extracting the capacitances among 3-D rectilinear-shaped conductors. The algorithm inside is the floating random walk (FRW) algorithm. The RWCap is free of discretization error, and suitable for the capacitance extraction of large-scale Manhattan VLSI layout.
